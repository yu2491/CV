## Yasmin Underdown

Aspiring software developer currently on a 12 week coding bootcamp with Makers Academy. Working in various industries over the years I found I got the most enjoyment from problem solving and using technology to streamline processes. After teaching myself Python and creating simple games such as Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4, I took the decision to pursue software engineering full time.
