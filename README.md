## Yasmin Underdown 

Aspiring software developer currently on a 16 weeks long coding bootcamp with Makers Academy. Working in various industries over the years I found I got the most enjoyment from problem solving and using technology to streamline processes. After teaching myself Python and creating simple games such as Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4, I took the decision to pursue software engineering full time.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving
At the GMC not every tribunal member was appearing on the correct training attendance list, causing us to look disorganised and giving the impression that we werenâ€™t expecting them. The error was due to the formulas in Excel being incorrect and not pulling the correct data through. I was able to fix the problem in time for future training sessions.

As a new starter at the Mole Clinic I was giving a lot of information on odd bits of paper which was messy if information changed and inaccessible if you didn't have the papers physically with you. I created an online guide book in order to solve both these issues. 

#### High attention to detail
During my time at IFDS I regularly received a low percentage of regulatory errors or financial penalties and one quarter was the best performer on the team, with a 100% accuracy during those 3 months.

## Hobbies

I love most sports and enjoy watching major competitions, in particular female team sports.
I currently play Tag Rugby in a local league every week and in 2012 I volunteered at the London Olympics, an experience I will never forget. I also have an active interest in climate change and equality particularly within the LGBT+
community and I enjoy problem solving games such as sudoku, lemmings and jigsaw puzzles.
