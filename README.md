## Yasmin Underdown

Aspiring software developer currently on a 12 week coding bootcamp with Makers Academy. Working in various industries over the years I found I got the most enjoyment from problem solving and using technology to streamline processes. After teaching myself Python and creating simple games such as Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4, I took the decision to pursue software engineering full time.

## Hobbies

I love most sports and enjoy watching major competitions, in particular female team sports.
I currently play Tag Rugby in a local league every week and in 2012 I volunteered at the London Olympics, an experience I will never forget. I also have an active interest in climate change and equality particularly within the LGBT+
community and I enjoy problem solving games such as sudoku, lemmings and jigsaw puzzles.
