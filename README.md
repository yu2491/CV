## Skills

#### Problem Solving
At the GMC not every tribunal member was appearing on the correct training attendance list, causing us to look disorganised and giving the impression that we werenâ€™t expecting them. The error was due to the formulas in Excel being incorrect and not pulling the correct data through. I was able to fix the problem in time for future training sessions.

As a new starter at the Mole Clinic I was giving a lot of information on odd bits of paper which was messy if information changed and inaccessible if you didn't have the papers physically with you. I created an online guide book in order to solve both these issues.

#### High attention to detail
During my time at IFDS I regularly received a low percentage of regulatory errors or financial penalties and one quarter was the best performer on the team, with a 100% accuracy during those 3 months.

## Hobbies

I love most sports and enjoy watching major competitions, in particular female team sports. Covid allowing I play Tag Rugby in a local league every week and in 2012 I volunteered at the London Olympics, an experience I will never forget. I also have an active interest in equality particularly within the LGBT+
community.
